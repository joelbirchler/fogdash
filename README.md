This is a quick and dirty dashboard for FogBugz.

# Up and Running

Copy the `config-example.json` to `config.json`. You'll need a token. See [the FogBugz documentation](http://fogbugz.stackexchange.com/fogbugz-xml-api) for details on how to retrieve it.

The team is the FogBugz project (`ixFixFor` in FB API speak).
